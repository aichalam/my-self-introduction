    <section class="intro">
        <p>Hello, I'm Aicha Lamrani, and I'm excited to share a more comprehensive view of my life with you. Originally from Morocco, my journey has been a vibrant tapestry woven with diverse experiences and passions.</p>

        <img src="swimming.jpg" alt="Swimming Puzzle" class="puzzle img-puzzle">
        <p>One of my greatest passions is swimming. The cool embrace of the water, the rhythmic strokes, and the soothing sounds create a sanctuary where I find both peace and strength.</p>

        <img src="cooking.jpg" alt="Cooking Puzzle" class="puzzle img-puzzle">
        <p>Culinary exploration is another realm I wholeheartedly embrace. Whether experimenting with exotic flavors or crafting beloved traditional dishes, the kitchen is my canvas, and each meal is an expression of creativity and love.</p>

        <img src="traveling.jpg" alt="Traveling Puzzle" class="puzzle img-puzzle">
        <p>Traveling is my perpetual adventure, a journey of self-discovery through exploration. It's not just about visiting places; it's about immersing myself in different cultures, tasting diverse cuisines, and creating memories that last a lifetime.</p>

        <p>My academic pursuits led me to attain a diploma in management, laying the foundation for a versatile skill set. Complementing this, I earned a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate, reflecting my commitment to education and cross-cultural understanding.</p>

        <img src="dancing.jpg" alt="Dancing Puzzle" class="puzzle img-puzzle">
        <p>Dancing is more than a hobby; it's a celebration of life. Through rhythmic movements, I connect with my emotions, express joy, and celebrate the beauty found in every moment.</p>

        <p>Having worked in the Ministry of Health, I've contributed to community well-being. Currently, as a dedicated student, I'm passionately involved in my own project, driven by the aspiration to make a positive impact on the world.</p>

        <p>Embracing a philosophy of continual growth and self-improvement, my goal is to be the best version of myself. This extends to both personal and professional realms as I navigate the exciting opportunities that the future holds.</p>

        <p>As a visual storyteller, I'm thrilled to share more about my journey with you. Below is a video that provides a glimpse into the experiences that have shaped me. Thank you for joining me on this enchanting adventure!</p>
